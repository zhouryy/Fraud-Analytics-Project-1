# Fraud-Analytics-Project-1
### Find Anomalies in NY Property Data
- You’ve just been hired by the city of NY. They think there might be some property tax fraud going on in their city, but they’re not sure.
They have no idea how to discover this. They can’t just look through all the records manually.
Their data is relatively large and fairly messy. About a million property records with about 32 fields. Many records have missing fields.
One record for each property. Fields are things like address, owner, property characteristics, assessed tax values…
They want you to build an algorithm that can look through their ~1 million property records to find potential tax fraud.
The kind of fraud they’re looking for is people underpaying tax by misrepresenting their property characteristics.
